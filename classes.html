<h2>Science</h2>
<p>Science is one of my favorite classes because it teaches us about how the world works and broadens our view on how everyday objects function. We also perform many fun experiments and labs in the class; not to mention Mr. Barrager is excellent at explaining science while making the classes enjoyable and fun. Science also links into many other subjects and explains how they work, furthering our understanding and allowing us to be thorough and complete when we accomplish other STEM related tasks.</p>

<h2>Study Hall</h2>
<p>Whose favorite class is not study hall? It is one of my favorite classes because it allows me to complete my homework faster and have more free time to do the things I enjoy the most. Not only that but it helps relive some stress of the homework load that I would otherwise have to do at home. If I have no homework that day, then the Study Hall becomes a limited free period, and I am able to do many other enjoyable activities.</p>

<h2>History </h2>
<p>History is one of my favorite subjects because I enjoy learning about the major events of history, why they happened, and how we can use that knowledge to avoid similar incidents in the future. Knowing these past mistakes also helps us become better people and help strive towards the “L” in TALI. It also gives us glimpses into other diverse cultures and helps us understand the actions of different people and allows us to control the urge to judge people the moment we meet them.</p>
