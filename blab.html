    <h2>Sports</h2>
        <p>Regarding Sports, I support the Marriners, Seahawks, and Kraken, and I suppose the Sounders even though I don't like soccer. I play a few sports like</p>
            <li>Tennis</li>
            <li>Ultimate Frisbee</li>
        <p>Even though I don't play a lot of sports, I am stil an avid sports enthusiast, I really enjoy both tennis and ultimate frisbee. In tennis, I enjoy the strategy with both the aspect of playing alone and teaming up with another player as well as the look on my opponents face when I hit a perfect shot. Similarly, ultimate frisbee is an excellent way to bond and connect with my friends when I may not have out of the classroom. </p>
